/*  Personality types — GP's own questionnaire, types, avatars and tips.

    The four preference pairs (Energy E/I, Information S/N, Decisions T/F,
    Structure J/P) and the sixteen four-letter codes are the same ones people
    know from Myers–Briggs, and those ideas are Jung's and long in the public
    domain. EVERYTHING ELSE here is written for this app: the forty statements,
    the type names, the descriptions, the tips and the avatars.

    That line matters and is easy to cross by accident. The official MBTI®
    questionnaire is copyrighted and "Myers-Briggs" and "MBTI" are trademarks of
    The Myers-Briggs Company; 16Personalities' test, their type names (the ones
    ending in -ist, -ate, -er …), their descriptions and their character art are
    theirs. Do not paste any of it in here, however close a match it looks — the
    screen may LOOK like theirs (a coloured group, a friendly character, a row
    of agree/disagree circles), but the words and pictures must stay ours.

    Plain script, no modules, like jobfocus.js: teams.html loads it with a
    <script> tag and reads the globals. Every string a person reads goes
    through t() at the point it is drawn, so it can be translated without
    touching this file (Khmer lives in km.js, split REVIEWED/PENDING as ever). */

/* ---------- the four groups ---------- */
/* color fills (avatars, bars, badges); ink is the same hue dark enough to be
   TEXT on the tint or on a card — the bright marigold is under 3:1 as text.
   Grouped by the middle two letters — what someone notices (S/N) and how they
   decide or relate (T/F for intuitives, J/P for sensors). The grouping itself is
   an old public idea; the names and colours are ours. */
