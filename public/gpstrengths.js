/*  GP Strengths — a free strengths finder, written for GP.

    Thirty-four strengths in four groups — Doing (9), Leading (8), Relating (9)
    and Thinking (8) — found through 102 "which is more like you?" choices.
    Everything in this file — the strengths, their names, the 204 statements,
    the descriptions and the grouping — is GP's own.

    At Uriah's request it is shaped as closely as it can be to CliftonStrengths:
    34 strengths, in four groups the size of Gallup's four domains, each one
    covering the ground of one Gallup theme, in Gallup's order (strengths.js
    maps them, for people who also record their real Gallup results). But it
    is NOT CliftonStrengths and must never become a copy of it. Gallup's 34
    theme names are its trademarks, and its questionnaire and descriptions are
    its own work, so: no Gallup theme name or a variant of one (not
    "Achieving", "Focused", "Communicator"…), no Gallup wording, no Gallup
    domain names, and the group colours are not Gallup's. tests/
    test-gpstrengths.mjs checks the names, variants included.

    WHY PAIRS, NOT AGREE/DISAGREE: on an agree scale people rate every good
    quality highly, and every strength comes out "strong". A choice between two
    good statements forces a ranking, which is what a Top 5 is. Every strength
    appears in exactly six pairs, always against a strength from a DIFFERENT
    group (and against every other group at least once), never against the same
    strength twice, three times on the left and three on the right (so nobody's
    favourite side decides their result), and never in two pairs in a row. Each
    of a strength's six statements is used once. The pairs are generated, then
    checked by the test.

    Scoring: each answer is -2 … +2 (much more like the left … much more like
    the right). The left strength gains -v, the right gains +v, so every
    strength ends between -12 and +12 (GP_GS_MAX). The SERVER does the adding
    up (api.js, gpStrengthsScore_) from the answers, so a Top 5 can never
    disagree with the choices that made it; this file does the same sum for the
    screen.

    Plain script, no modules, like jobfocus.js. Every string a person reads
    goes through t() where it is drawn (Khmer in km.js, PENDING as ever). */
